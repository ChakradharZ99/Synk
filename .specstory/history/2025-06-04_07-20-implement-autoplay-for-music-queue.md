# Implement autoplay for music queue (2025-06-04 12:50:08)

_**User**_

i want to implement autoplay i.e., play next song in queue just after the current song finishes

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement autoplay functionality for the music queue. Let me first check the relevant code to understand the current implementation.

Based on the code search results, I can see that the application already has the necessary components to implement autoplay functionality. The `SpotifyWebPlayer` component already has an `onTrackEnd` callback that gets triggered when a song finishes playing. We just need to connect this with the queue management system.

Let me check the room page implementation to see how we can integrate this:

Let me read more of the room page to see the full implementation:

I can see that the autoplay functionality is already partially implemented! The `SpotifyWebPlayer` component has an `onTrackEnd` callback that's connected to the `skipSong` function, which moves to the next song in the queue. However, this only works for premium users who are the host.

Let me check the backend implementation to see how the queue management works:

Great! I can see that the autoplay functionality is already implemented in the codebase. Here's how it works:

1. The `SpotifyWebPlayer` component has an `onTrackEnd` callback that gets triggered when a song finishes playing
2. This callback is connected to the `skipSong` function in the room page
3. The `skipSong` function calls the backend's `skipCurrentSong` method
4. The `skipCurrentSong` method:
   - Removes the current song
   - Takes the highest voted song from the queue
   - Sets it as the current song
   - Sorts the remaining queue

The autoplay functionality is already working for premium users who are the host of the room. When a song finishes playing, it automatically moves to the next song in the queue.

For non-premium users or non-hosts, they can still see the queue and vote on songs, but they need to use the Spotify app to play the music. The queue will still update automatically when songs finish playing, but they'll need to manually start the next song in their Spotify app.

Would you like me to make any changes to this implementation? For example, I could:

1. Add a visual indicator when a song is about to end
2. Add a countdown timer for the next song
3. Add a notification when the next song starts playing
4. Make any other improvements to the autoplay experience

Let me know what you'd like me to do!

there is some gap its not working after song finishes progress bar returns 0 and its pausing the song but not playing enxt song

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the SpotifyWebPlayer component to see what might be causing this issue.

I see the issue. The problem is in the `player_state_changed` event listener. The current logic for detecting when a track has ended is not quite right. Let me fix this:


---

```diff
        
          const currentUri = state.track_window.current_track?.uri;
-         const ended =
-           state.paused &&
-           state.position === 0 &&
-           currentTrack?.uri &&
-           currentTrack?.uri !== currentUri;
+         const ended = state.paused && state.position === 0;
        
          setCurrentTrack(state.track_window.current_track);
```

```diff
        
          if (ended) {
-           console.log("Detected track end, calling onTrackEnd");
+           console.log("Track ended, calling onTrackEnd");
            onTrackEndRef.current?.();
          }
```

---

I've simplified the track ending detection logic. The previous implementation was too complex and had some issues:

1. It was checking if the current track URI was different from the previous track URI, which could cause issues with the autoplay
2. It was requiring the current track to exist, which might not always be the case
3. The conditions were too strict, making it harder to detect when a track actually ended

The new logic simply checks if:
1. The player is paused (`state.paused`)
2. The position is at the start (`state.position === 0`)

This is a more reliable way to detect when a track has ended naturally. When these conditions are met, we call the `onTrackEnd` callback, which will trigger the next song to play.

Let me also add some additional error handling and logging to help debug any issues:


---

```diff
        try {
          setPlaybackError(null)
+         console.log("Playing track:", trackUri);
          const response = await fetch(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play?device_id=${deviceId}`, {
            method: "PUT",
```

```diff
          if (!response.ok) {
            const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}))
+           console.error("Playback error response:", errorData);
            if (response.status === 404) {
              setPlaybackError("Track not available or requires Premium")
```

```diff
              variant: "destructive",
            })
+         } else {
+           console.log("Track playback started successfully");
          }
        } catch (error) {
+         console.error("Error playing track:", error);
          setPlaybackError("Failed to play track")
          toast({ title: "Playback Error", description: "Failed to play track", variant: "destructive" })
```

I've made two main changes to fix the autoplay issue:

1. Simplified the track ending detection logic to be more reliable
2. Added better error handling and logging to help diagnose any issues

The autoplay should now work more reliably. When a song finishes playing:
1. The player will detect that the track has ended (paused and position at 0)
2. It will call the `onTrackEnd` callback
3. This will trigger the `skipSong` function
4. The next song in the queue will be played automatically

If you're still experiencing issues, please check the browser console for any error messages that might help identify the problem. Also, make sure that:

1. You're logged in with a Spotify Premium account
2. You're the host of the room
3. There are songs in the queue
4. The Spotify Web Playback SDK is properly initialized

Let me know if you're still having issues and I can help investigate further!

skip was hit twice now idk why

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check why the skip is being triggered twice. Looking at the code, I can see a potential issue in the `player_state_changed` event listener. The current logic might be triggering the `onTrackEnd` callback multiple times due to how we're detecting the track end.

Let me modify the code to prevent double triggers:


---

```diff
    const lastTrackUri = useRef<string | null>(null)
    const onTrackEndRef = useRef(onTrackEnd)
+   const hasTriggeredEnd = useRef(false)
  
    useEffect(() => {
```

```diff
          setDuration(state.duration);
        
-         if (ended) {
+         if (ended && !hasTriggeredEnd.current) {
            console.log("Track ended, calling onTrackEnd");
+           hasTriggeredEnd.current = true;
            onTrackEndRef.current?.();
+         } else if (!ended) {
+           hasTriggeredEnd.current = false;
          }
        });
```

---

I've made the following changes to prevent double triggers:

1. Added a `hasTriggeredEnd` ref to track whether we've already triggered the end callback for the current track
2. Modified the `player_state_changed` event listener to:
   - Only trigger `onTrackEnd` if we haven't already triggered it for this track (`!hasTriggeredEnd.current`)
   - Set `hasTriggeredEnd` to true when we trigger the callback
   - Reset `hasTriggeredEnd` to false when the track is no longer in the ended state

This should prevent the double trigger issue by ensuring that:
1. We only trigger the end callback once per track
2. We reset the trigger state when a new track starts playing
3. We don't trigger the callback again until the track actually ends

The issue was likely happening because the Spotify Web Playback SDK might send multiple state changes when a track ends, and our previous logic wasn't tracking whether we had already handled the end event.

Let me know if you're still seeing any issues with the skip behavior!
